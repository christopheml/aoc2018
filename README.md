# Advent of Code 2018 in Kotlin

This year I decided to spice things up a bit and give Kotlin a try.

## Progress log

### Project Setup

I created the project using the Maven archetype `kotlin-archetype-jvm` from IntelliJ. Needed to update the Kotlin IDE
plugin to match the Kotlin version from the archetype (`1.3.10`).

I added my usual testing dependencies, `junit` and `assertJ`.
