# Advent of Code 2018 in Kotlin

This year I decided to spice things up a bit and give Kotlin a try.

## Progress log

### Project Setup

I created the project using the Maven archetype `kotlin-archetype-jvm` from IntelliJ. Needed to update the Kotlin IDE
plugin to match the Kotlin version from the archetype (`1.3.10`).

I added my usual testing dependencies, `junit` and `assertJ`. 

### Day 1

I expected day 1 to be rough because my knowledge of Kotlin at that point is super limited. Fortunately, online 
documentation is pretty good. I'm still thinking like I was programming in Java though, which means that I write code
that is not idiomatic to Kotlin in a lot of places.

Overall language seems nice and very expressive. String interpolation is awesome, using `if` for ternaries is nice and 
the `when` construct is great too.
